# Change Log

## [0.2.2] - 2019-01-23

- Updated Unicode table to version 11 ðŸ¦™.

## [0.2.1] - 2018-11-17
- Added `insert-unicode.disable-pre-filtering` which can be used to skip the initial search step and disable paging.

  Due to a previous Visual Studio Code update, the dropdown is now virtualized, greatly increasing its performance when many items are available. It still can take a small amount of time to display with all Unicode entries and the live filtering can lag noticeably. Results may vary depending on processing power.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-07-15
- Added "Unicode Fonts" command.

## [0.1.0] - 2018-05-25
- Initial release.
