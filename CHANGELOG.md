- Overhaul Read-Me format to explicitly list all commands.
- Add small *How To* section to Read-Me.

## [0.6.0] - 2019-03-05

- Update Unicode table to version 12 ðŸ§‡.

## [0.5.0] - 2019-03-01

- Added `Identify Unicode Characters` command and option to control whether the results are always displayed as file (`show-identified-characters-in-file`).

## [0.4.1] - 2019-02-18

- Fix sequences not being found if pre-filtering is enabled (`disable-pre-filtering: false`) due to different casing.

## [0.4.0] - 2019-02-18

- Added Emoji (v.12.0) sequences such as flags ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ.
  - Whether these sequences appear as entries in the list can be controlled with the setting `insert-unicode.include-sequences`.
  - Likewise the appearance of skin tone variation entries is controlled via the setting `insert-unicode.include-skin-tone-variants`.<br/>
    These variations are not included by default as they clutter the list significantly.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-02-04

- Renamed commands to avoid potential confusion:
  - Suffix `(Text)` for insert commands was dropped.
  - Suffix `(Hex Code)` was changed to `as Hex Code`.

## [0.2.2] - 2019-01-23

- Updated Unicode table to version 11 ðŸ¦™.

## [0.2.1] - 2018-11-17
- Added `insert-unicode.disable-pre-filtering` which can be used to skip the initial search step and disable paging.

  Due to a previous Visual Studio Code update, the dropdown is now virtualized, greatly increasing its performance when many items are available. It still can take a small amount of time to display with all Unicode entries and the live filtering can lag noticeably. Results may vary depending on processing power.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-07-15
- Added "Unicode Fonts" command.

## [0.1.0] - 2018-05-25
- Initial release.
